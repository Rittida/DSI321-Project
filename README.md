# DSI321-Project
Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline with Visualization

For our DSI321: Big Data Infrastructure project, we will analyze near real-time air quality data. The focus is on monitoring PM2.5 concentration levels across various regions in Thailand using data collected from automatic air quality monitoring stations. This project aims to build an efficient data pipeline that can ingest, process, and visualize air quality data to support public awareness and environmental decision-making.
